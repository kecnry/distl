multiplying a [Gaussian distribution](../api/Gaussian.md) by a float or integer treats that float or integer as a [Delta distribution](../api/Delta.md).  In this case, it is able to return another [Gaussian distribution](../api/Gaussian.md).  When unable to return a supported distribution type, a [Composite distribution](../api/Composite.md) will be returned instead.


```python
print(2*g)
```

    <distl.gaussian loc=20.0 scale=4.0>



```python
print(g*2)
```

    <distl.gaussian loc=20.0 scale=4.0>



```python
out = (g*2).plot(show=True)
```

Note that this gives us the same resulting distribution as if we defined a [Delta distribution](../api/Delta.md) manually and multiplied by that.


```python
d = distl.delta(2)
```


```python
print(g*d)
```

    <distl.gaussian loc=20.0 scale=4.0>



```python
out = (g*d).plot(show=True)
```

If we multiply in the other order, we'll get a [Composite distribution](../api/Composite.md), but see that it gives us the same resulting sample.


```python
print(d*g)
```

    <distl.delta loc=2.0>*<distl.gaussian loc=10.0 scale=2.0>



```python
out = (d*g).plot(show=True)
```


![png](math_files/math_14_0.png)


Note that since the floats/integers are treated as distributions, `2*g` is **not** equivalent to `g+g` (note the change in the x-limit scale on the plot below compared to those above).


```python
print(g+g)
```

    <distl.gaussian loc=10.0 scale=2.0>+<distl.gaussian loc=10.0 scale=2.0>



```python
out = (g+g).plot(show=True)
```

# Supported Operators

* multiplication
* division
* addition
* subtraction
* np.sin, np.cos, np.tan

(for and/or logic, see [these examples](and_or.md))


```python
g = distl.gaussian(2*np.pi, np.pi/6)
```


```python
print(np.sin(g))
```

    sin(<distl.gaussian loc=6.283185307179586 scale=0.5235987755982988>)


**TODO**: the issue here is not the pdf itself, but rather that interval is giving the incorrect range for some reason.


```python
out = g.plot_pdf(show=True)
```


![png](math_files/math_22_0.png)



```python
out = np.sin(g).plot_pdf(show=True)
```

out = np.sin(g).plot_cdf(show=True)
```

out = np.sin(g).plot(show=True)
```
